                Are you feeling positive? Because if you're not, then I have some great personal tips that I use to help me get through my day or just life in general. 
                I will be sharing my philosopies on how I deal with certain situations, but please take whatever resonates with you.
             </p>  
        </ul>
        <h1>Tip #5-Having A Strong Mind:</h1>
        <ul>
            <p>
              Having a strong mind is very important, and what I mean by that is when you have, a  strong mind 
              you are able to block out the negativity. When you are able to block out the negativity, you will be able
              to do all kinds of amazing things that you thought you could never do before.
            </p>
        </ul>
        <h1>Tip #4-Believing In Something:</h1>
        <ul>
            <p>
                I believe if you believe in something- it could be anything- like for example, crystals, astrology, religion, yourself, or anything that helps you out with 
                being positive. No matter what it is, it is supposed to promote positivity, help you grow as a person, and help you find yourself. Once you find yourself,
                it will help you be more positive.
            </p>
        </ul>
        <h1>Tip#3-Do Something You Want To Do:</h1>
        <ul>
            When doing something you want to do, it puts you in a really good positive mindset. Like for example- with me- I like coding and computers. 
            Being in the field of technology is something I really love and I'm passionate about. Because of this choice I made, I personally became
            more happier and saw more of a positive change in my life.
        </ul>
        <h1>Tip#2-Go out:</h1>
        <ul>
            <p>
                In my opinion, a great stress reliever to overcome negativity is really going out, seeing friends, or just really getting out of the house.
                When getting out of the house, you are able to really just forget all the negativity you have at home or wherever you have been. It may not work for everyone,
                considering that you might be sad or depressed that you're going out still and cant really forget it. Yet, it does have potential to make things better and really help you 
                look at the situation in a different light.   
            </p>
        </ul>
        <h1>Tip#1-Research:</h1>
        <ul>
            <p>
                A great way to expand your knowledge and really help you in a positive way is by researching, 
                There are many great videos like Ted talks, articles, fourms, or really anywhere. There are so many things you can use that are available to you.
                We live in a time where we have millions of websites at just a touch of a button on our smartphones. You may run into people who may have the same 
                experiences you are dealing with. We are in a great time where people can easily express themselves online and have someone come help you.

    <p id="middle">
        My name is Phillip Rodriguez I really hope this helps anyone dealing with issues on having a positive mindset. 
        I really devoloped this throughout my life and it took a long time to get to the point I'm at now. When I was growing up I was told many negative things and at the time
        I didnt really know how to overcome them. My family really did do a number on me as a kid mentally. I felt at times not confident at all in myself
        or my capabilities of becoming successful. For that reason I did things that I regret just to try and impress them by going into a major in college that really wasn't for me.
        Until I realized that I shouldn't care what they think and really just focus on myself.
